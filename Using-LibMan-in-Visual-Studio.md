# Visual Studio support for LibMan

Visual Studio has built-in support for using LibMan in Web Projects, including:

- support for configuring and running LibMan restore operation on build
- menu items for triggering LibMan **restore** and **clean** operations
- dialog that helps you search for libraries and add the files to your project
- editing support for the [LibMan manifest file](libman-manifest) (libman.json)

Though LibMan can work from any folder or any project type (via CLI or a CI build script), within Visual Studio, LibMan features are only available Web Projects.

## Getting started with LibMan

Open a Web Project in [Visual Studio 2017](https://visualstudio.com/vs) (v15.8 Preview 3 and above).

! If you're looking to get started with a new Web Project, see the [Getting Started - Razor MVC guide](getting-started-with-web).

You can add files to your web project two ways:
1. Use the "Add Client-Side Libraries" dialog
2. Edit the libman.json file in the root of the project

## Add Client-Side Libraries

- Choose a folder that you want to add files to (or a parent thereof).
- Right-click the folder and select **Add->Client-Side Librarie...**<br>

  The "Add Client-Side Libraries" dialog will open with focus in the **Library** field.<br>
- Type the name of a library you want to fetch (ie. "jquery", "twitter-bootstrap")<br>
  IntelliSense will provide a list of libraries starting with the name given.
- Select the correct item then press Tab.<br>
  The library ID will be completed with the "@" symbol followed by the latest version known to that provider.<br>
  Focus will move to the files selection radio buttons.
- To include all files in the specified library, set the radio button to "Include all library files".
- To specify a smaller set of files from the library, choose the "Select library files" option, which will enable the file selector tree with a smaller set selected by default.<br>
  Use the checkboxes to the left of the files to select the files to download.

- Specify the location of the new files within your web project. (Where do you want the files to go?)<br>
  Note: It is recommended to keep each library in a separate folder. The default location suggested for the new files will be a folder with the same name as the library under the directory the dialog was launched from.<br>
  Modify the **Target Location** as necessary.
- Press **Install**.<br>
  The configuration will be written to libman.json in the project root and the files will be downloaded into the project.<br>

## Edit the LibMan Manifest (libman.json)

All LibMan operations are based on the content of the LibMan manifest, which is the libman.json at the root of the project.

You can manually edit this file to define the library files that should be downloaded into the project.

Visual Studio offers editing support for the libman.json file, including coloring, formatting, IntelliSense and schema validation.
